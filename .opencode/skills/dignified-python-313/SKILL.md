description: Load ONLY when Python 3.13 is the active Python environment.
  Use when writing, reviewing, or refactoring Python to ensure adherence to LBYL exception
  handling patterns, modern type syntax (list[str], str | None), pathlib operations,
  ABC-based interfaces, absolute imports, and explicit error boundaries at CLI level.
  Also provides production-tested code smell patterns from Dagster Labs for API design,
  parameter complexity, and code organization. Essential for maintaining dignified
  Python standards.

# Dignified Python - Python 3.13 Coding Standards

## Core Knowledge (ALWAYS Loaded)

## Conditional Loading (Load Based on Task Patterns)

Core files above cover 80%+ of Python code patterns. Only load these additional files when you detect specific patterns:

Pattern detection examples:

- If task mentions "click" or "CLI" → Load `cli-patterns.md`
- If task mentions "subprocess" → Load `subprocess.md`

## How to Use This Skill

1. **Core knowledge** is loaded automatically (LBYL, pathlib, ABC, imports, exceptions)
2. **Type annotations** are loaded automatically (common syntax + Python 3.13 specific features)
3. **Additional patterns** may require extra loading (CLI patterns, subprocess)
4. **Each file is self-contained** with complete guidance for its domain
